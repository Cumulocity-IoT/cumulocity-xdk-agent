# cumulocity_xdk_agent

Device agent for Bosch XDK to connect to Cumulocity (C8Y Agent for XDK).

In order to connect the XDK to Cumuloxity a tenant is required: https://cumulocity.com/try-for-free/

## Overview of features XDK device agent

The agent runs in either of two modes: REGISTRATION or OPERATION mode.
When the device agent starts the fist time it is in REGISTRATION modes (this mode is recognized when no MQTTUSER, MQTTPASSWORD is defined in config.txt).

The XDK agents supports device registration as described here: https://cumulocity.com/guides/rest/device-integration/

After successful registration - vales for MQTTUSER, MQTTPASSWORD are received and saved in config.txt - the XDK restarts automatically.
After restarting the agent uses values for MQTTUSER, MQTTPASSWORD to connect to C8Y and runs in OPERATION mode. In this mode configured sensor measurements are sent to C8Y.

### Configuration
The C8Y Agent for XDK sends following sensor measurements to C8Y :
- ACCELENABLED=<TRUE TO SEND MEASUREMENTS, FALSE OTHERWISE> | default-value true
- GYROENABLED=<TRUE TO SEND MEASUREMENTS, FALSE OTHERWISE> | default-value true
- MAGENABLED=<TRUE TO SEND MEASUREMENTS, FALSE OTHERWISE> | default-value true
- ENVENABLED=<TRUE TO SEND MEASUREMENTS, FALSE OTHERWISE> | default-value true
- LIGHTENABLED=<TRUE TO SEND MEASUREMENTS, FALSE OTHERWISE> | default-value true
- NOISEENABLED=<TRUE TO SEND MEASUREMENTS, FALSE OTHERWISE> | default-value false

with the defined streamrate:
- STREAMRATE=<RATE TO SEND MEASUREMENTS TO C8Y IN MILISECONDS>| default-value 5000

Measurements types can be switched on/off in config.txt by setting the value to true/false. 

### Operations
The XDK can receive operations and messages initiated in your C8Y tenant. So you can :
- change streaming rate: 
-- send shell command from C8Y (publish any 1000 ms): "speed 1000" 
- toggle yellow light upon receiving any message:
-- for this define device dashboard and use "message" widget
- restart XDK from C8Y:
-- select XDk device in C8Y cockpit and execute "Restart device" from dropdown-menue "More"
- toggle yellow light:
-- send shell command: "toggle"

### Buttons
The buttons have following on the XDK have the following functions:

 	* Button one dot: stop/start sending measurements to Cumulocity
	* Button two dots: reset boot status stored on device flash to "NOT_IN_BOOT_PROCESS"
		
## Steps required to register and operate XDK device in C8Y tenant

1. Prepare SD card
2. Register XDK in Cumulocity & Upload SMART Rest Template
3. Install XDK Workbench: https://xdk.bosch-connectivity.com/de/software-downloads
4. Prepare project 
5. Flash your C8Y Device Agent on your XDK		
		
## 1. Prepare SD card
		
1. Format SD in FAT format
2. Adapt settings in config.txt and copy to SD card. A template for config.txt exists in the project "cumulocity-xdk-agent/resources"

## 2. Register XDK in Cumulocity & upload SMART Rest Template

1. Before starting the XDK a C8Y device registration for the XDK has to be created in your C8Y tenant. Pls. see https://www.cumulocity.com/guides/users-guide/device-management.
2. The agent uses the MAC of the WLAN chip. Pls. check on sticker on the bottom side of your XDK under "WLAN: 7C_7C_7C_7C_7C_7C" , e.g. XDK_7C_7C_7C_7C_7C_7C
> NOTE: prepend XDK_ before WLAN MAC adress
3. Upload SMART Rest Template "XDK_Template_Collection.json" from folder resources/XDK_Template_Collection.json to your C8Y tenant. Pls see https://www.cumulocity.com/guides/users-guide/device-management for required steps

## 3. Install XDK Workbench 

Install  XDK Workbench: https://xdk.bosch-connectivity.com/software-downloads
> NOTE: Installationpath must not not contains blanks 
> NOTE: The current version of the Workbench 3.6.0 defines a buffer size that is not sufficient for the certificat being used for Cumulocity.

In order to avoid a buffer overflow, as seen in the following error message:

INFO | XDK DEVICE 1: MQTT_ConnectToBroker_Z: connecting secure
INFO | XDK DEVICE 1:         11 [SSL:1] Sec_receiveCB: HORRIBLE Buffer full state=1 (0x200023fc)

Increase MBEDTLS_SSL_MAX_CONTENT_LEN macro value from 4850 to 5950 in Common/config/MbedTLS/ MbedtlsConfigTLS.h in line 2923.
The macro MBEDTLS_SSL_MAX_CONTENT_LEN determines the size of both the incoming and outgoing TLS I/O buffer used by MbedTLS library.

## 4. Prepare project 

1. Clone git repository
```
git clone https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-xdk-agent.git
```
2. In XDK Workbench import project into your workspace
3. In XDK Workbench: project clean and project build
4. Connect XDK over USB cable

## 5. Flash your C8Y Device Agent to your XDK

NOTE: connect your XDK using USB cable to get debug messages.
 
1. Flash project to XDK using the XDK Workbench 3.6.0
2. After starting the XDK the agent runs in "Registration Mode" and waits until the registration is accepted in your cumulocity tenant. So you have to accept the registration in your C8Y tenant. See as well step 2.1.
3. After accepting the registration in C8Y the XDK agent receives device credentials and stores these on the SD card.
4. The XDK restarts and runs now in "Operation Mode". After this you should see measurements in C8Y.

## Procedure when re-registering device in Cumulocity tenant

1. Delete entries MQTTUSER und MQTTPASSWORD from the file "config.txt" stored on the SD card
2. Delete XDK from Cumulocity Tenant. Navigate to the device in the Cockpit and delete device
3. Restart XDK and register XDKs again as before

## Troubleshooting

### When the following error occusrs after building and flashing the project please clean, rebuild and flash project again:

```
 INFO | Transmission successfully completed!
 INFO | Booting application...
 INFO | XDK DEVICE 1:  Performing application CRC validation (this will take a couple of seconds)
 INFO | XDK DEVICE 1: Application Firmware Corrupted
 INFO | XDK DEVICE 1:  Invalid application
```

### The following error indicates, that the workspace path contains spaces. PLEASE remove spaces from the workspace:

```
mingw32-make -j 2 -j8 cleanÂ 
C:\XDK-Workbench\XDK\make\mingw32-make.exe -C C:\XDK-Workbench\XDK\SDK/xdk110/Common -f application.mk clean

```

### When th efollowing error occurs, please right-click project cumulocity-xdk-projectConfigure -> Add  XDK nature

```

## Sample dashboard

A sample dashboard can be build using the resources/Container_V01.svg.   
Please see: https://www.cumulocity.com/guides/users-guide/optional-services/ for a documentation on how to use the svg in a SCADA widget.

![Sample Dashboard](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-xdk-agent/blob/master/resources/Container_V01.jpg)  

Dashboard from above is build using the following components:
1. SCADA widget on the basis of SVG Container_V01.svg
2. Rotation widget to show the position of he XDK
3. Alarm widget to show recent alarms. This requires to define a smart rule "Container open": https://cumulocity.com/guides/users-guide/cockpit/#smart-rules  
The rule "On measurement explicit threshold create alarm" is using the measurement "c8y_Light" with min 50000 and max 100000
4. Data point widget with data points "c8y_acceleration=>accelerationX", "c8y_acceleration=>accelerationY" and "c8y_acceleration=>accelerationZ"

## TLS Certificate

For TLS the certificate of the CA has to be flashed to the XDK.  
This certificate in included in the header file source\ServerCA.h in PEM format. The currently included certificate from "Go Daddy Class 2 Certification Authority" is used for tenants *.cumulcity.com.  
If your CA is different this needs to be changed.
